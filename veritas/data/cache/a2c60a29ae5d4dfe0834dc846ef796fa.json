  "response": "**Audit Report: Website Investigation of https://www.avrut.com/**\n\nThis audit report presents the findings of a comprehensive investigation into the website https://www.avrut.com/, which yielded a Trust Score of 42/100, indicating a suspicious rating. Based on the evidence collected, our analysis reveals several concerns regarding the website's design and entity verification.\n\n**Visual Analysis Findings**\n\nOur visual analysis detected eight dark patterns on the website, including one critical pattern. Specifically, we identified instances of visual interference, including a prominent call-to-action (CTA) button (\"Schedule a Meeting\") with a size ratio of 1.5, which may interfere with the user's attention (confidence score: 90%). Additionally, we found a misdirected click pattern, where the \"Get Free Consultation\" button is more prominent than the \"Skip Free Consultation\" option (confidence score: 95%). Furthermore, our analysis revealed disguised ads in the form of CTA buttons (confidence score: 80%) and sponsored content sections (confidence score: 60%). We also detected a hidden cancel option, which may make it difficult for users to cancel their subscriptions (confidence score: 90%).\n\n**Entity Verification Findings**\n\nOur entity verification analysis revealed that the domain age is approximately 1979 days, which is equivalent to approximately 5.4 years. However, we were unable to verify the company's identity, with a confidence score of 30% for both instances of \"Avrut\" mentioned on the website.\n\n**Domain Intelligence Findings**\n\nOur domain intelligence analysis revealed that the website has a valid SSL certificate, but we were unable to retrieve the WHOIS information.\n\n**Conclusion and Risk Assessment**\n\nBased on the evidence collected, we conclude that the website https://www.avrut.com/ exhibits several suspicious characteristics, including dark patterns and unverifiable entity information. These findings suggest a moderate to high risk of potential deception or manipulation of users. We recommend exercising caution when interacting with this website and verifying the entity's identity through alternative means.",
