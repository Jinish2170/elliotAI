# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-23)

**Core value:** Every implementation works at commit time. Build incrementally with explicit tests, verify each phase before proceeding, and deliver a production-ready system suitable for portfolio/job demonstration. Quality over speed - broken code is unacceptable.
