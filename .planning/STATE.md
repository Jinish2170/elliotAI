# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-23)

**Core value:** Every implementation works at commit time. Build incrementally with explicit tests, verify each phase before proceeding, and deliver a production-ready system suitable for portfolio/job demonstration. Quality over speed - broken code is unacceptable.
**Current focus:** Phase 6: Vision Agent Enhancement

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 11 (Vision Agent Enhancement)
Plan: 6 of 6 in current phase
Status: In progress - Plan 06-05 complete
Last activity: 2026-02-24 — VisionEventEmitter with 5 sec throttle, 5 findings batch, flush queue

Progress: [███████████████░░░░░░] 100% (6/6 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 28 (22 v1.0 + 6 v2.0)
- Average duration: ~4.3 min (v2.0 only)
- Total execution time: ~26 min (v2.0 only)

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Duration | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| 1     | 22    | TBD   | TBD      | TBD      |
| 6     | 6     | 6     | ~26 min  | ~4.3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last plan: 06-05 (6 min)
- Trend: Steady v2.0 execution with modular feature implementation

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 06-Vision Agent Enhancement P06-05 | 6min | 5 tasks | 3 files | VisionEventEmitter with websocket throttling/batching

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1.0 Core Stabilization: Production-grade foundation shipped 2026-02-23
- v2.0: Masterpiece features implemented with 6-phase structure aligned with 6-week timeline
- Vision Agent first: Multi-pass visual analysis provides foundation for all downstream features
- Quality-first: False positive prevention built in from Phase 7 (multi-factor validation)
- **06-01 Cache Key Design (2026-02-24)**: Used MD5 hash combining image_bytes + prompt + pass_type for deterministic pass-specific caching
- **06-01 Pass-Type Isolation (2026-02-24)**: Each pass in 5-pass Vision Agent pipeline gets its own cache entry for GPU cost optimization
- **06-02 Pass Priority System (2026-02-24)**: Used three-tier enum (CRITICAL/CONDITIONAL/EXPENSIVE) enabling 3-5x GPU cost reduction through smart VLM pass skipping
- **06-03 Pass-Specific Prompts (2026-02-24)**: 5 distinct prompts optimized for each analysis target (quick threat, dark pattern taxonomy, temporal, entity verification, synthesis)
- **06-03 5-Tier Confidence Mapping (2026-02-24)**: Numerical scores (0-100) mapped to alert levels (low/moderate/suspicious/likely/critical) for granular classification
- **06-03 Temporal Context Injection (2026-02-24)**: SSIM score, has_changes flag, and region count injected into Pass 3 prompt for enhanced temporal analysis
- **06-04 CV Temporal Analysis (2026-02-24)**: Used 640x480 resize for memory efficiency (0.3MP per image), adaptive SSIM thresholds per content type (e_commerce: 0.15, subscription: 0.20, news/blog: 0.35, phishing/scan: 0.10)
- **06-05 Event Emitter Design (2026-02-24)**: Used queue-based rate limiting (max 5 events/sec) with batching (5 findings per event) to prevent WebSocket flooding during 5-pass analysis; integrated via ##PROGRESS: stdout markers
